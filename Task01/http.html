        HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, Developed by Timothy
        Berners-Lee.
      </li>
      <li>It is used in client-server communication</li>
      <li>
        HTTP user sends the request to the server &amp; the server sends the
        response to the user
      </li>

        By using HTTP, user sends the request to the server &amp; the server
        sends the response to the user.

    <h3>HTTP1.1</h3>
    <p>
      Step 1: The client (browser) has to send a request to the server using the
      method (GET/POST).
    </p>
      <p>Step 2: Server responds with the requested resource,
        for example – image, alongside the status of what it did to the client’s
        request.</p> 
    </p>
    <p>But this is not a one-time process. Such requests and responses needs to 
        be transferred between both these machines until the client receives 
        all the resources, essential to load a web page on the end-user’s 
        (your) screen.</p>
    <p>Example:
        GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: www.example.com</p>
        <p>   HTTP/1.1 includes, <strong style="text-transform:capitalize;">
            performance enhancements, including keepalive
             connections, caching mechanisms, request pipelining, transfer 
             encodings, and byte-range requests.</strong>
            </p>
    <h3> Disadvantage of HTTP1.1</h3>
    <p>The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests &amp; responses 
        in the plain text message form. The second one is head of line blocking
         in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the 
         response does not receive. all the information related to the header 
         file is repeated in every request.</p>
    <h3>HTTP2</h3>
    <p>HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol(SPDY - Speedy in terms is a protocol for 
        transporting web content over the internet, designed to reduce page load 
        times and improve overall performance. The protocol was first introduced 
        by Google in 2009, Obsolete now), developed primarily at Google with the 
        intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as 
        compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer. This layer encapsulates messages – 
        converted to its binary equivalent – while making sure that its HTTP 
        semantics (method details, header information, etc.) remain untamed. </p>
